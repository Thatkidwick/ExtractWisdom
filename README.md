An AI prompt project that uses AI to extract wisdom from all sorts of text, from podcast transcripts, conversations, talks, lectures, papers, articles, blog posts, essays, presentations, or whatever you can get into text form.

## The problem

There is too much good content out there, and too little time.

## The ExtWis (Extract Wisdom) solution

The purpose of the project is to output the points that **I would have ideally captured by hand** if I had 2-3 hours to watch and rewatch the content, and then another 2-3 hours to meticulously capture hand-written notes on the most interesting aspects.

These include:

- A summary of the content
- The main ideas 
- The most insightful quotes
- The most interesting opinions
- Influences of the speakers or the content
- Habits of the speakers
- Facts or background on the topics
- Resources for further reading
- Nuggets of wisdom
- Recommendations based on what was talked about
- A rating of how urgently you should watch the whole thing
